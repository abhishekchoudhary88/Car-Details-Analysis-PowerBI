🔄 What is Happening in This Project (Step-by-Step)
Step 1: Data Import

Car data is imported into Power BI

Data source is connected and loaded

Step 2: Data Cleaning (Power Query)

Using Power Query Editor, the following tasks are performed:

Removing unnecessary columns

Handling missing or inconsistent values

Correcting data types

Renaming columns for clarity

This step ensures clean and accurate data.

Step 3: Data Transformation

Columns are formatted properly

New calculated columns are created if required

Data is prepared for analysis

Step 4: Data Modeling

Relationships are established between tables (if multiple tables exist)

Data model is optimized for reporting

This helps Power BI generate accurate visuals.

Step 5: DAX Measures & KPIs

Custom measures are created using DAX, such as:

Total Cars Sold

Average Selling Price

Maximum and Minimum Price

Sales distribution by fuel type or brand

These KPIs provide quick insights at a glance.

Step 6: Dashboard Creation

Interactive visuals are created, including:

Bar charts (brand-wise or fuel-wise analysis)

Line charts (price trends over years)

Cards (KPIs like total sales, average price)

Filters & slicers for dynamic analysis

Users can interact with visuals to explore insights.

Step 7: Insights & Analysis

The dashboard helps answer questions like:

Which car brands sell the most?

How does price vary by fuel type?

What is the impact of mileage on selling price?

Which year models have higher resale value?

📊 Key Insights

Price varies significantly based on brand and fuel type

Newer cars generally have higher resale value
